# Predix Machine - 16.1.0-SNAPSHOT
#
# Configuration properties for the Predix Machine Device Technician console
#
# Service_PID = com.ge.dspmicro.device.techconsole
#

# Usage: 
# 
#       Properties set in this file may use the full property
#       name. For example:
#                  
#             <service_pid>.<property_key>=<property_value>



# Note: 
#
#       Properties in configuration files are subject to a delay
#       as they rely on the config-admin and fileinstall bundles.
#
# Format: 
#       type character followed by a quoted string representation of value. 
#          e.g a boolean -  property=B"true"
#       Lowercase type character implies primitives. Type can be omitted for String.
#       Types:
#           T = String            I = Integer            L = Long
#           F = Float             D = Double             X = Byte
#           S = Short             C = Character          B = Boolean
#
#       Array format is property=<type>["<value1>","<value2>"]. 
#           e.g. array of int - property=i["1", "2", "3"]
#       A backslash may be used to break up the line for clarity.
#

# If the technician console bundles (webconsole.ini) are installed in this container then on startup the
# technician console will only be available if this property is true. Setting it false and 
# restarting the container will remove the webconsole.ini from the bundle list.
com.ge.dspmicro.device.techconsole.console.enabled=B"false"

# Automatically disable the web console after a set amount of time (in seconds)
# This is a safety measure to prevent the web console from being available after provisioning
#
com.ge.dspmicro.device.techconsole.console.autodisable=B"true"
com.ge.dspmicro.device.techconsole.console.autodisable.time=I"43200"
